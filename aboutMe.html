        <h1><em>Hello</em>, my name is <strong>Adela</strong>.</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>I am a Per Diem Registered Nurse aspiring to become a Full Stack Developer by the end of 2020. I am currently enrolled at Epicodus, a six-month coding bootcamp graduating this July.</h4>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>I graduated from University of Washington with a B.S. in Biology/Physiology in 2013 and Seattle University with a B.S. in Nursing in 2015. Since working as a Charge Nurse at Swedish Medical Center, I realize I have passion in leadership, discovering new work gadgets/technologies and learning that lasts a lifetime.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I discovered computer science through my husband's work as a Software Engineer at LinkedIn and fell in love with the work culture. Since then, I have set goals to be a part of that. My goal is to build good foundational skills and level up every day one <span style="font-style:italic">commit</span> at a time.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Outside of school/work, I love to spend my time in the kitchen (be it cooking or eating) or watch Korean dramas at home. You may also find me walking my dog, Chloe, out with my husband, Ivan in Issaquah Highlands, Washington.</p>
