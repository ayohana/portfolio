    <h1>Hello, my name is Adela.</h1>
    <h4>I am a part-time Registered Nurse aspiring to become a Full Stack Developer by the end of 2020. I am currently enrolled at Epicodus Coding Bootcamp. My goal is to build good foundational skills and level up every day one <span style="font-style:italic">commit</span> at a time.</h4>
    <p>I graduated with a B.S. in Biology/Physiology at University of Washington in 2013 and a B.S. in Nursing at Seattle University in 2015. Since working as a Charge Nurse at Swedish Medical Center, I realize I have passion in leadership and I am committed to lifelong learning.</p>
    <p>I discovered computer science through my husband's work as a Software Engineer at LinkedIn and fell in love with the work culture. Since then, I have set my goal to be a part of that.</p>
    <p>Outside of school/work, I love to spend my time in the kitchen (be it cooking or eating) or watch Korean dramas while learning Korean at home. You may also find me walking my dog, Chloe out with my husband, Ivan, in Issaquah Highlands, Washington.</p>
