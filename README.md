## Known Bugs

1.10.2020 at 5:03PM:
_Top Navigation Bar:_ when the viewport's width is less than 576px (extra small devices), the links of the top navigation bar are not aligned in the center. This is due to Bootstrap's default responsive breakpoints. Please see reference below.

> _// Extra small devices (portrait phones, less than 576px)_
>
> _// No media query for `xs` since this is the default in Bootstrap_
>
> _// Small devices (landscape phones, 576px and up)_
>
> _@media (min-width: 576px) { ... }_
